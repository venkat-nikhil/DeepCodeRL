# text1="Title: Replacing Digits\n\nYou are given an integer a that consists of n digits. You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.\n\nYour task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.\n\nThe given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes.\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\nExamples:\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1024\n010\nOutput:\n1124\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n987\n1234567\nOutput:\n987\nExplanation:\n\nEach replacement step uses each s digit once. So all four s digits are used.\n\nIn this case, note that in example 2, when s has many digits longer than needed, but perhaps it's better to arrange them optimally.\n\nSo your task is to find which positions to change so that a becomes as large as possible.\n\nConstraints:\n\nn <= 1e5, m up to 1e5.\n\nHmm.\nOkay, let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nWe have two inputs:\n\nFirst input is a number 'a' as a string since dealing with integers might cause issues if a is very long. Wait, actually looking back at the problem statement: wait, the initial description says \"integer a that consists of n digits\". But in programming problems, sometimes we handle strings rather than numbers for easier manipulation. Maybe I should treat 'a' as a string throughout.\n\nWait, yes, probably because handling it as a numeric variable could lead to overflow or precision issues, especially considering that the constraints allow n and m up to 1e5. Therefore, treating 'a' and 's' as strings seems manageable.\n\nSo steps:\n\nGiven:\n\n- String 'a' representing the number (without leading zeros)\n- String 's' consisting of some digits; each character represents a possible replacement.\n\nGoal: Replace exactly k digits in 'a', where k is up to min(m, len(a)), such that the new 'a' is maximized. Each digit in 's' can be used only once per replacement. Also, each replacement must pick a digit in 'a' and replace it with a digit from 's'. Importantly, each digit in 's' can be used only once across all replacements—meaning that using a certain digit from 's' may prevent others from being used later.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet's think about what needs to happen. For each position in 'a', if we decide to replace it, we need to choose a digit from 's' such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\nMoreover, since each digit in 's' can be used at most once, we need to select which digits in 'a' to replace and in what order to maximize the overall value.\n\nThis sounds similar to a greedy approach where we process the digits from left to right, trying to make each position as large as possible, while ensuring that the remaining digits are sufficient to cover the required replacements.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Convert both 'a' and 's' into lists for easier manipulation, since strings are immutable in Python.\n\n2. Start processing each digit of 'a' from left to right. At each step, decide whether to replace this digit or leave it as is, based on whether there are enough digits in 's' left to perform the necessary replacements.\n\n3. For each current digit in 'a':\n\n   a. If it's larger than the smallest available digit in 's', then we can replace it with the largest possible digit from 's' (to maximize the increase). But wait, maybe just choosing the highest possible digit would give the best result? Or perhaps it depends on how many digits are left to replace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to keep track of how many digits we've already replaced, and how much remains.\n\nAnother idea is to iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right. For each position, determine the optimal way to replace it to get the maximum value, considering the remaining digits in 's'.\n\nAt each step:\n\n- Let's say we have a current index i in 'a' (starting from 0).\n\n- We know that we have some target digits left in 's' to replace other positions.\n\nFor example, suppose after processing up to position i, we've decided to replace k digits in total (k >= i +1), meaning that we still have (m - k) digits left to choose from 's'.\n\nWhen processing the next digit at position i+1:\n\nCase 1: It's greater than or equal to the smallest digit in 's' (but perhaps this isn't correct, because perhaps even though it's higher, but we don't have enough digits left in 's' to fill the remaining spots.)\n\nBut perhaps another angle: for each position i in 'a', we want to check if we can replace it with a digit from 's' such that:\n\n- The digit chosen from 's' is as large as possible, but also such that the remaining digits in 's' can cover the required replacements beyond this point.\n\nThus, here's a possible algorithm outline:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\n- a_index = 0 (current position in 'a')\n- s_index = 0 (current position in 's')\n- remaining_replacements = len(s)\n\nWhile a_index < len(a):\n\n   Get current digit a_digit = a[a_index]\n\n   Find the maximum digit in 's' starting from s_index. Call this candidate_max.\n\n   Then, compute how many digits in 's' are left after choosing this candidate_max.\n\n   Compare whether replacing this a_digit with the candidate_max gives a higher value, considering the rest of the replacements.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps greedily take the highest possible digit from 's' that allows us to maximize the current digit, and proceed.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the problem:\n\nSince we can use each digit in 's' once, the goal is to replace the earliest possible positions with the largest possible digits from 's', provided that there are enough digits left to complete all required replacements.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n1. Sort the list of digits in 's' in descending order.\n\n2. Iterate over each digit in 'a' from left to right.\n\n3. For each digit at position i:\n\n   a. Look at the sorted digits in 's' starting from the beginning.\n\n   b. Check if replacing this digit with the current digit from 's' will yield the maximum possible value, considering the remaining digits in 's'.\n\n   c. If replacing is beneficial, replace it with the largest possible digit from 's' that hasn't been used yet.\n\nBut perhaps the exact logic requires checking all possibilities.\n\nHowever, given the size constraints (n and m up to 1e5), an O(n log m) solution is acceptable, but anything worse may not be feasible.\n\nLet's consider an efficient method:\n\nWe can pre-process the sorted list of 's' digits in descending order. Because to maximize the number, the earlier digits are more significant.\n\nThen, for each position in 'a' from left to right, we can see if we can improve the digit by selecting a suitable digit from 's' (possibly larger than the current digit). However, once a digit is selected, it cannot be used again.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm goes like this:\n\nSort 's_digits' in descending order.\n\nCreate a pointer j starting from 0, indicating which digit in 's_digits' we're currently considering.\n\nStart iterating over each position i in 'a' from 0 to len(a)-1:\n\n   current_digit = a[i]\n\n   if j >= len(s_digits): break, no more replacements.\n\n   candidate = s_digits[j]\n\n   if candidate > current_digit:\n\n      then replace a[i] with candidate, increment j.\n\n      continue to next iteration.\n\n   else:\n\n      check if we can replace a[i] with current_digit (which is less than candidate), but this would decrease the number, which is not desired. Thus, perhaps it's better to skip replacing unless we find a higher digit.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the above approach is insufficient because sometimes replacing with a lower digit may allow more higher digits further on.\n\nAlternative idea: Since our aim is to create the maximum number, whenever possible, we should replace the earliest possible digit with the largest possible available digit.\n\nThus, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Sort 's' in descending order.\n\n- For each position in 'a' from left to right:\n\n   if we haven't exhausted all 's' digits yet:\n\n       look for the largest digit in 's' that is smaller than the current digit in 'a' at this position.\n\n       if found, replace it with this digit.\n\n       remove this digit from 's' for future replacements.\n\n       move to next position.\n\n   else:\n\n       leave the current digit as is.\n\nBut this approach may not always work correctly because perhaps leaving a digit in place may allow us to replace multiple subsequent digits with larger ones.\n\nSo perhaps a better way is to construct the best possible string step by step.\n\nIdea:\n\nWe can represent 'a' as a list of characters for easy modification.\n\nWe sort the 's' digits in descending order.\n\nThen, for each position i in 'a' from 0 to len(a)-1:\n\n   if i is beyond len(s) or s_index >= m: break.\n\n   current_digit = a[i]\n\n   # Try to find the largest possible digit in s that is larger than current_digit.\n\n   # Use binary search to find the first digit in s that is larger than current_digit.\n\n   low = s_index\n\n   high = m -1\n\n   res = None\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       if s[mid] > current_digit:\n\n           res = mid\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   if res is not None:\n\n       # Need to replace current_digit with s[res], but before doing so, ensure that there are enough digits left.\n\n       # After replacement, the count of s_used is increased by 1.\n\n       # Wait, perhaps after finding the res, we should make sure that there are enough digits left to reach the required count.\n\n       # For instance, suppose the original 'a' had len(a) = N, and s has M digits.\n\n       # Suppose initially, the required number of replacements is K, which is min(len(a), len(s)).\n\n       # So during the process, as we go along, the number of replacements made increases.\n\n       # Hmm, perhaps this complicates things.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of thinking about the entire string, perhaps focus on making each digit as large as possible, starting from the left, using the available digits in 's'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Convert 'a' into a list for easy modifications.\n\n2. Sort the 's' digits in descending order.\n\n3. Initialize a variable called 'replacements_needed' to 0.\n\n4. Traverse each digit in 'a' from left to right:\n\n   a. For each position i:\n\n      i. While replacements_needed < m and s[s_index] > a[i]:\n\n          - Replace a[i] with s[s_index]\n\n          - Increment s_index by 1\n\n          - Decrement replacements_needed by 1\n\n      ii. Break out of loops and proceed to next digit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we try to replace the earliest possible digit with the largest possible digit from 's', without exceeding the required number of replacements.\n\nYes! This makes sense. Because for each position, we try to replace it with the largest possible digit from 's' that is larger than the current digit. Once done, we proceed to the next position.\n\nThis way, we ensure that the earliest digits are maximized, giving the highest possible number.\n\nLet's test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\na = \"1024\" → ['1','0','2','4']\n\ns = \"010\" → ['0','1','0'], sorted in descending order: ['1','0','0']\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\nreplacements_needed starts at 0.\n\ni=0: a[0] is '1'\n\nCheck if any s digits are larger than '1'? Well, s is ['1','0','0'].\n\nLooking for s[d] > '1': none.\n\nSo no replacement. Move on.\n\ni=1: a[1] is '0'.\n\nNow, s_index is 0. Check if s[0] ('1') > '0'? Yes.\n\nReplace '0' with '1', increments s_index to 1, decrements replacements_needed to 1.\n\nProceeding to i=2: a[2] is '2'.\n\ns_index is now 1. Current s digit is '0' which is less than '2'. No action.\n\nProceed to i=3: a[3] is '4'.\n\ns_index is 1, s[1] is '0' < '4'. No action.\n\nSo final a is '1124' which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\na = \"987\", s = \"1234567\"\n\nSorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1']\n\nWe have to replace as many digits as needed.\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\ni=0: a[0]='9'\n\nLook for s[d]> '9'? s is all <=9 except '7' which is less than 9. Wait, s is '1','2','3','4','5','6','7', sorted as ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1']. So s[d] for d=0 is '7' which is less than '9'. So no replacement possible until we have enough replacements.\n\nBecause '987' is three digits, and s has seven digits. So we can replace all three digits.\n\ni=0: a[0] is '9', s_index is 0. Looking for s[d] > '9'? Not possible. So proceed.\n\ni=1: same situation.\n\ni=2: same.\n\nThus, no replacements are made because even though s has seven digits, they are all less than '9'. So the code will leave a as is.\n\nBut wait, according to the sample explanation, each replacement uses each s digit once. Wait, perhaps the problem allows using all digits from s, including those beyond the current a's length.\n\nIn this case, the sample shows that all four s digits are used. Wait, wait, perhaps I misread the sample.\n\nWait, sample input 2:\n\na is '987' (length 3)\n\ns is '1234567' (length 7)\n\nThe output is '987' because all replacements would require more digits than available.\n\nWait no: the output is '987', meaning no replacements were made. Because in the sample explanation, each replacement step uses each s digit once, implying that all s digits are used.\n\nBut perhaps my initial reasoning was incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine sample input 2:\n\nIn sample input 2:\n\na is 987.\n\ns is 1234567.\n\nAfter replacing each s digit once, the output is '987' with all digits kept.\n\nBut why? Because each replacement uses a s digit, and in this case, since we have to replace k digits such that k <= len(s). Wait, perhaps we have to replace as many as possible, but only up to the length of a.\n\nNo, perhaps the problem is that we can replace up to len(s) times, but not necessarily.\n\nPerhaps the key is that each digit in s can be used once, regardless of their order.\n\nIn sample 2, since a has 3 digits and s has 7, perhaps the question is whether the maximum number can be achieved by replacing all possible digits.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nIn any case, let's return to the algorithm.\n\nImplementing the approach:\n\nConvert 'a' to a list, say 'digits_a'.\n\nSort 's' in descending order, store as 'sorted_s'.\n\nInitialize 'replacements_left' as the minimum of len(digits_a), len(sorted_s)).\n\nSet 'index' to 0.\n\nLoop over each position in 'digits_a':\n\n   if index >= len(sorted_s): break.\n\n   current_digit = digits_a[index]\n\n   # Now, find the largest possible digit in sorted_s that is greater than current_digit.\n\n   # Since sorted_s is in descending order, we can binary search for the first digit > current_digit.\n\n   low = 0\n\n   high = len(sorted_s) -1\n\n   best_index = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       if sorted_s[mid] > current_digit:\n\n           best_index = mid\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   if best_index != -1:\n\n       # Replace current_digit with sorted_s[best_index], but only if we have enough replacements left.\n\n       # How many replacements are left?\n\n       # Since sorted_s is processed in order, perhaps after replacing, the index moves forward.\n\n       # Wait, perhaps instead of tracking, just calculate how many replacements are made.\n\n       num_replacements_made = 0\n\n       # Perhaps the following is better:\n\n       # Instead of tracking index, just loop through each digit in 'a' and for each, try to find a replacement.\n\n       # So let's adjust the approach.\n\n       # Alternative Approach:\n\n       # Since each replacement can be considered as taking the next largest possible digit, perhaps the initial algorithm can be modified as follows:\n\n       # For each digit in 'a', from left to right:\n\n       #   if we have enough s digits left:\n\n       #       choose the largest possible digit from s, which is larger than current digit.\n\n       #       replace current digit with this digit.\n\n       #       mark this digit as replaced, decrement s index.\n\n       # So perhaps:\n\n       # Create a copy of sorted_s.\n\n       # Keep track of how many s digits are left to use.\n\n       # Loop through each position in 'a':\n\n       #   if s_index >= len(sorted_s): break.\n\n       #   current_digit = digits_a[i]\n\n       #   # Find the largest digit in sorted_s that is larger than current_digit.\n\n       #   # Using binary search.\n\n       #   # All digits in sorted_s are >= previous digits.\n\n       #   # Find the first digit in sorted_s that is > current_digit.\n\n       #   left = s_index\n\n       #   right = len(sorted_s) -1\n\n       #   max_possible = -1\n\n       #   while left <= right:\n\n       #       mid = (left + right) //2\n\n       #       if sorted_s[mid] > current_digit:\n\n       #           max_possible = mid\n\n       #           left = mid +1\n\n       #       else:\n\n       #           right = mid -1\n\n       #   if max_possible == -1:\n\n       #       continue\n\n       #   else:\n\n       #       # Take this digit, replace current_digit with sorted_s[max_possible]\n\n       #       digits_a[i] = str(sorted_s[max_possible])\n\n       #       s_index +=1\n\n       #       # Only proceed if we have enough replacements.\n\n       #       if s_index >= len(sorted_s):\n\n       #           break\n\n       # So applying this logic.\n\nTesting this on sample 1:\n\nOriginal a: [1,0,2,4]\n\nsorted_s: ['1','0','0']\n\ni=0: current_digit='1'\n\nBinary search in sorted_s for digits>1. The digits are '1' which is not >1. So no replacement.\n\ni=1: current_digit='0'\n\nSearch for digits>0. Sorted_s is ['1','0','0'].\n\nCompare mid points.\n\nBut perhaps in the first pass, for i=1:\n\ncurrent_digit is '0'.\n\nCheck if any digit in sorted_s is > '0'.\n\nThe first digit is '1', which is > '0'.\n\nSo take '1' (the first occurrence where digit>0?), or wait, perhaps the code takes the first occurrence in sorted_s that is larger than current_digit.\n\nIn the code above, for i=1:\n\nmax_possible will be set to the first position where digit> current_digit.\n\nWhich is index 0 in sorted_s (since sorted_s[0] is '1' > '0').\n\nSo digits_a[1] is replaced with '1', s_index increases to 1.\n\nThen, moving on to i=2: current_digit is '2'.\n\nCheck sorted_s[1:] is ['0','0'].\n\nDo these have any digits> '2'? No.\n\nThus, no replacement.\n\nFinally, the result is '1124', matching the sample.\n\nAnother test case: Sample 2.\n\na = '987' → digits_a is ['9','8','7']\n\ns = '1234567' → sorted_s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1']\n\nlen(a)=3, len(s)=7.\n\nWe start with s_index=0.\n\nProcess i=0:\n\ncurrent_digit='9'\n\nFind the largest digit in sorted_s that is > '9'? None, since sorted_s is ['7','6','5','...'].\n\nThus, no replacement.\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_digit='8'\n\nSame as above. Any digit in sorted_s> '8'? The first digit is '7' which is less than '8'. Next digits are '6','5', etc., all less than '8'.\n\nThus, no replacement.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_digit='7'\n\nAgain, no digits in sorted_s>7.\n\nThus, no replacement occurs. So the result is '987', as expected.\n\nAnother scenario: What if 'a' is '54321' and s is '98765'.\n\nWe have to replace as many digits as possible.\n\nWe can process each digit:\n\ni=0: current_digit='5'\n\nLooking for largest digit in s (['9','8','7','6','5']) that is >5.\n\nIt's '9' at index 0.\n\nReplace '5' with '9', s_index becomes 1.\n\nResulting a is '94321'.\n\nNext, i=1: current_digit='4'\n\nCheck if any digits in s (from index 1 onwards) >4. The next digits are ['8','7','6','5'].\n\nThe largest is '8'.\n\nReplace '4' with '8', s_index becomes 2.\n\nResult is '98321'.\n\ni=2: current_digit='3'\n\nDigits in s from index 2 onward: ['7','6','5'].\n\nLargest is '7' >3.\n\nReplace '3' with '7', s_index becomes3.\n\nResult is '98721'.\n\nContinue until s_index reaches end or all digits are processed.\n\nThus, the algorithm works.\n\nHence, implementing this approach.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\n1. Read 'a' as a string.\n\n2. Read 's' as a string.\n\n3. Convert 'a' into a list of characters for easy mutation.\n\n4. Sort 's' in descending order.\n\n5. Compute the maximum possible replacements: min(len(a), len(s)).\n\n6. Initialize s_index to 0.\n\n7. Iterate through each character in 'a' (each index i):\n\n   a. current_char = a_list[i]\n\n   b. Binary search in the sorted_s list for the largest digit greater than current_char.\n\n   c. If found, replace current_char with that digit, increment s_index, and proceed.\n\n   d. Else, proceed to next i.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in some cases, after replacement, there are still replacements needed. For example, perhaps it's better to replace a digit that is in the middle, allowing for more changes elsewhere.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, since the algorithm prioritizes replacing the earliest digit with the largest possible digit, it should produce the optimal result.\n\nThus, implement this approach.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nIn Python, for each i in range(len(a_list)):\n\n   current_d = a_list[i]\n\n   # find the largest digit in sorted_s that is > current_d.\n\n   # To find this, perform binary search.\n\n   low = s_index\n\n   high = len(s_sorted) -1\n\n   best_pos = -1\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       if s_sorted[mid] > current_d:\n\n           best_pos = mid\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   if best_pos != -1:\n\n       # replace a_list[i] with s_sorted[best_pos]\n\n       a_list[i] = s_sorted[best_pos]\n\n       s_index +=1\n\n       if s_index >= len(s_sorted):\n\n           break\n\nOnce all replacements are done, join the a_list into a string and print.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nTest Case 1:\n\na = '1', s = '9'\n\nReplaced, becomes '9'.\n\nTest Case 2:\n\na = '999', s = '000'\n\nNo replacements, as all digits in s are less than '9'.\n\nTest Case 3:\n\na = '1234', s = '4321'\n\nPossible replacements:\n\nFor i=0: '1' < '4' → replace with '4'; s_index=1.\n\ni=1: '2' vs s[1]='3' → replace with '3'; s_index=2.\n\ni=2: '3' vs s[2]='2' → no. Wait, no, since in the next step, s_index is 2.\n\nWait, let's simulate.\n\nInitial a_list: ['1','2','3','4']\n\ns_sorted = ['4','3','2','1']\n\nlen(a)=4, len(s)=4.\n\ni=0: current_d='1'\n\nfind the largest in s_sorted that is >1.\n\ns_sorted[0] is '4' >1 → replace.\n\na_list[0] = '4'; s_index=1.\n\ni=1: current_d='2'\n\nlook for s_sorted[1]= '3' >2 → yes. Replace with '3'; s_index=2.\n\ni=2: current_d='3'\n\nlook for s_sorted[2]='2' → which is not >3. So no.\n\ni=3: current_d='4'\n\ncheck s_sorted[3]='1' <4 → no.\n\nThus, a becomes '4324' ?\n\nWait, but perhaps this is suboptimal.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach would yield a better result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to process each digit in order, and for each, attempt to replace with the highest possible digit that hasn't been used yet and is higher than the current digit.\n\nThus, the code as outlined earlier should handle this.\n\nNow, writing the code accordingly.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nWhat if the number 'a' is empty or something? But according to constraints, a is non-empty.\n\nAlso, ensure that s is properly handled, e.g., converting to lowercase or uppercase as needed.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, s's digits are consecutive without separators, but the digits themselves are treated as is.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nRead a as input().strip()\n\nRead s as input().strip()\n\nIf len(s) is zero, return a as is.\n\nElse:\n\nSort s in descending order.\n\nIterate through each digit in a, perform the replacement as described.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when s is empty, nothing happens.\n\nHandle all cases.\n\nAnother thing: When len(a) < len(s), then only len(a) digits are replaced.\n\nBut in code, the s_index is incremented until it reaches len(s_sorted).\n\nThus, let's write the code.\n\nHandling the binary search part.\n\nLet's code:\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    a = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    if not a:\n        print(''.join(a))\n        return\n    \n    # Make copies for processing\n    a_list = list(a)\n    s_sorted = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    n = len(a)\n    m = len(s_sorted)\n    \n    s_index = 0\n    max_replacements = min(n, m)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_d = a_list[i]\n        \n        # Binary search for the largest digit in s_sorted that is > current_d\n        low = s_index\n        high = m -1\n        best_pos = -1\n        \n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n            if s_sorted[mid] > current_d:\n                best_pos = mid\n                low = mid +1\n            else:\n                high = mid -1\n        \n        if best_pos != -1:\n            # Replace current_d with s_sorted[best_pos]\n            a_list[i] = s_sorted[best_pos]\n            s_index +=1\n            \n            # Check if we can replace more digits\n            if s_index >= m:\n                break\n    \n    # Join and print\n    print(''.join(a_list))\n    \nsolve()\n\nTesting this with sample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1024\n\n010\n\nAfter sorting s: ['1','0','0']\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: current_d='1'. Search for s_sorted[mid] >1.\n\nAll s_sorted are ['1','0','0']: no digit >1. Best_pos remains -1.\n\nSo no replacement.\n\ni=1: current_d='0'. Binary search finds s_sorted[0] ='1' >0. Replace '0' with '1'. s_index becomes1.\n\ni=2: current_d='2'. s_sorted[1] is '0' <2. Search continues but no higher. No replacement.\n\ni=3: current_d='4'. Still no replacement.\n\nFinal a_list is ['1','1','2','4'] → '1124'.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSample2:\n\nInput:\n\n987\n\n1234567\n\nAfter sorting s: ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1']\n\nProcess each digit:\n\ni=0: current_d='9' → s_sorted[0]='7'<9 → no replacement.\n\ni=1: current_d='8' → s_sorted[0]='7' <8 → no.\n\ni=2: current_d='7' → compare s_sorted[0]='7' → not >7. But s_sorted[1]='6' <7. So no.\n\nThus, no replacements. Output '987' as expected.\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\na='555', s='999'.\n\nAfter sorting s: ['9','9','9']\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: current_d='5' → find the first digit in s_sorted >5. Which is '9' at pos0.\n\nReplace '5' with '9' → s_index=1.\n\ni=1: current_d='5' → find next digit>5. s_sorted[1] is '9' >5. Replace with '9', s_index=2.\n\ni=2: current_d='5' → replace with '9', s_index=3.\n\nFinal a: '999'.\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\na='1234', s='9087'\n\ns_sorted: ['9','8','7','0']\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: current_d='1' → find '9' >1 → replace with '9', s_index=1.\n\ni=1: current_d='2' → find '8' >2 → replace with '8', s_index=2.\n\ni=2: current_d='3' → find '7' >3 → replace with '7', s_index=3.\n\ni=3: current_d='4' → find '0' <4 → no.\n\nFinal a: '9874'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given integer `a` after performing a series of replacements using digits from another sequence `s`. Each digit in `s` can be used only once, and we aim to achieve the maximum possible value by strategically replacing digits in `a`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to replace digits in `a` such that the resulting number is the largest possible. Each digit from `s` can be used at most once, and we can prioritize using larger digits from `s` to maximize the value of `a`.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the digits of `s` in descending order, we can efficiently find the largest possible digit that can replace each digit in `a` from left to right. This ensures that each replacement maximizes the value of `a` as early as possible.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Convert `a` into a list of characters for easy manipulation.\n   - Sort the digits of `s` in descending order.\n   - Iterate through each digit of `a`, attempting to replace it with the largest possible digit from `s` that is larger than the current digit. Track the number of replacements made to ensure we do not exceed the limit set by the length of `s`.\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Sorting `s` takes O(m log m) time, and iterating through `a` involves binary search operations on `s`, ensuring the solution is efficient even for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    a = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    if not a:\n        print(''.join(a))\n        return\n    \n    a_list = list(a)\n    s_sorted = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    n = len(a)\n    m = len(s_sorted)\n    \n    s_index = 0\n    max_replacements = min(n, m)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_d = a_list[i]\n        \n        low = s_index\n        high = m - 1\n        best_pos = -1\n        \n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if s_sorted[mid] > current_d:\n                best_pos = mid\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        \n        if best_pos != -1:\n            a_list[i] = s_sorted[best_pos]\n            s_index += 1\n            \n            if s_index >= m:\n                break\n    \n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the input values for `a` and `s`.\n2. **Initialization**: Convert `a` into a list of characters and prepare the sorted version of `s`.\n3. **Replacement Logic**: For each digit in `a`, use binary search to find the largest possible digit from `s` that can replace it. Update the result list and track the number of replacements.\n4. **Output**: Finally, join the modified list into a string and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the value of `a` efficiently by leveraging sorting and binary search to make optimal replacements."
